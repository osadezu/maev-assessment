# Maev FE Assessment

Candidate: Oscar SÃ¡nchez de Zulueta

## Notes on my implementation

- Some design parameters are assumed to apply to all buttons in the project, those changes were made directly in the theme.js dictionaries. Other component-specific parameters are inlined as sx attributes.
- The arrow icon was inserted as inline SVG for simplicity. This should be ok for a few isolated graphics, but if many different graphics are needed we could use SVGR to load SVG files directly. This might require CRA/webpack config changes to the project.
- In the Figma document, the Primary button default state does not appear to perfectly center the text + arrow on the width of the button. However, other buttons do, so even spacing on both sides is assumed as the general intent.
- An arbitrary margin was added to the text container in some cases to visually center the text vertically.
